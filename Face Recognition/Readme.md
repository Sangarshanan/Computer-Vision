# Face Recognition using Siamese Neural Network

In order to understand the reason why we have one-shot learning, we need to talk about deep learning and data. Normally, in deep learning, we need a large amount of data and the more we have, the better the results get. However, it will be more convenient to learn only from few data because not all of us are rich in terms of how much data we have.

Also, the brain doesn’t need thousands of pictures of the same object in order to be able to recognize it. But let’s not talk about the brain analogy because it is far more complicated and powerful, and many things are involved in our process of learning and memorization such as feelings, prior knowledge, and interactions, etc.

The idea here is that we need to learn an object class from only a few data and that’s what One-shot learning algorithm is.

## Siamese neural network


Siamese neural network has the objective to find how similar two comparable things are (e.g. signature verification, face recognition..). This network has two identical subnetworks, which both have the same parameters and weights.
